## What I Learned

This message board project taught me a lot of useful things like Pug and Express as well as using a hosting provider. Until I made this project, I had never experimented with hosting providers and always just used GitHub Pages. While I like GitHub Pages for static sites, it is not suitable for dynamic sites. For this reason, I decided to use Fly.io, which seemed like a reasonably good PaaS provider. Using Express made working with Node.js easier, and I now see why Express is considered a good option.

## Conclusion

Making interactive web apps is fun and an enjoyable process, especially for this project. This was a great learning experience and a project I will be taking notes from. It's a simple message board, but I enjoyed the process of making it.
